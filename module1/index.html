      <p> This was the very first module of fablab for its very first batch. <br>Here we have learned all about WEB DEVELOPMENT, from its very basics to advance.
         <br> Firstly we have understood the different tags that are used in Hyper Text Mark up Language to builed a very basic skeleton of HTML. <br>
              After that we have learned about the CASCADING STYLE SHEET, which is used to design our web document. <br>
            CSS plays a huge role in front end development. <br>
            Then we have learned about the Java Script which is a programming language to make our WEB page responsive.
